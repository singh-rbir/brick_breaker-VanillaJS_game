Created with CodeSandbox

This is a simple browser brick-breaker game I made using the html Canvas and plain javascript. This project was possible because of a follow along tutorial on Youtube by FreeCodeCamp.org.

It was my first beginner pet project using simple languages like html, css and javascript.
